# Gramercy Studios

AI-native development and consulting. We build products where agents are the architecture — not an add-on.

## What We Do

We help teams rethink how products should work when an agent is part of the architecture. Conversational platforms that replace traditional dashboards. Intent-driven interfaces. Data structured for agent consumption from the ground up.

## Selected Work

**[Mosaic](https://mosayic.ai)** — AI-native interactive persona platform. Instead of reading a document about someone, visitors have a conversation with their AI persona. Same data serves four surfaces: conversation, visual display, external AI tools via MCP, and agent-first web discoverability.

**Neo** — Autonomous codebase exploration agent. Point it at any public GitHub repo and ask questions in natural language. The agent explores, reads, reasons, and explains — running in ephemeral Cloudflare Sandbox containers.

**[gramercystudios.com](https://gramercystudios.com)** — Our website is itself AI-native. An agent is woven into every page, responding in context about the work and thinking it sits alongside. A working demonstration of the architecture we bring to client work.
